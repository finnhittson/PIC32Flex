# PIC32Flex 

PIC32Flex is a breakout board for the PIC32MX170F256B. This repo holds schematic revision information, how to facbricate this board for yourself, and examples on how to use the boar. I designed this board for rabid prototyping, testing, and better wire management for projects and circuits that use the PIC32 as a microcontroller. Specifically, I made PIC32Flex for Stanford's ME218 mechatronics course sequence which exclusively uses the PIC32 as the microcontroller for all student projects. For this reason, it is wired to interface directly with the [MPLAB Snap](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/pg164100) and the [CP2102 debugger](https://www.silabs.com/interface/usb-bridges/classic/device.cp2102?tab=specs).
